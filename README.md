# Mayank Raj

Hello! I'm Mayank, a Machine Learning Engineer from Jersey City, NJ. My background includes a Masters degree in Machine Learning, with a focus on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also happen to be a Software Engineer with more than 2 years of work experience in Backend Development. I'm skilled at fixing scaling issues, implementing new features, and upgrading microservices to handle more traffic. I'm looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in Generative AI and Deep Learning to tackle challenging problems.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayank-raj77) or check out my [portfolio](https://mayank-raj37.netlify.app/).

### [Deep Learning Projects]
A collection of projects demonstrating the use of deep learning techniques in various scenarios:

- **[Voice-enabled RAG chatbot](https://github.com/mayank3aj3769/chatbot.git)**: Voice-enabled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built on the LLaMA-2 model, integrated with Pinecone for vector search and LangChain for managing the chat capabilities. It is designed to understand and respond to voice queries by referencing content within PDF documents and delivering responses in a synthesized voice.
- **[Lexical Complexity Predictor](https://github.com/mayank3aj3769/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/11548fc1881932d000cfa9ddf6e6635c7c999573/Lexical%20Complexity%20Score%20Predictor%20using%20a%20BERT%20Based%20model)**: Predicting the complexity of words using transformer-based models like BERT and RoBERTa.
- **[LLM for Sentiment Analysis of market conditions based on global news reports ](https://github.com/mayank3aj3769/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/11548fc1881932d000cfa9ddf6e6635c7c999573/Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20market%20conditions%20based%20on%20global%20news%20reports.ipynb)**: Using sentiment analysis to predict market conditions from global news reports.
- **[Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews](https://github.com/mayank3aj3769/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/11548fc1881932d000cfa9ddf6e6635c7c999573/Sentiment%20analysis%20of%20IMDB%20reviews%20using%20word2vec%20in%20np%20and%20tf.ipynb)**: Analyzing sentiments in movie reviews using a Word2Vec model in TensorFlow.
