# Mayank Raj

Hello! I'm Mayank, a Machine Learning Engineer from Jersey City, NJ. My background includes a Masters degree in Machine Learning, with a focus on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also happen to be a Software Engineer with more than 2 years of work experience in Backend Development. I'm skilled at fixing scaling issues, implementing new features, and upgrading microservices to handle more traffic. I'm looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in Generative AI and Deep Learning to tackle challenging problems.
